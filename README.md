## Extension Set Up

1. Create a Vercel Project
1. Create a Vercel Personal Access Token with permissions to deploy the project created on step 1 (see the [Vercel PAT Set Up](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-a-vercel-api-access-token) guide for more information)
1. If you're planning on using the Pull Request Commenting Task, create an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token with permissions to Read/Write Pull Request threads (see the [Azure PAT set up](#azure-pat-set-up) guide for more information)
1. Store the tokens as secret variables in your preferred methodology. Azure recommends using the [UI, Variables Groups, or Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/set-secret-variables). Whichever methodology you use, make sure it is accessible from Azure Pipelines.
1. Navigate to the [Vercel Deployment Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vercel.vercel-deployment-extension) Visual Studio Marketplace page and add the extension to your organization.
   > Note: This step will not work until the extension is shared with the user or we make the extension public.
1. With the extension added, you are now ready to use the tasks in your Azure Pipeline. The tasks are referable using `vercel-deployment-task` and `vercel-azdo-pr-comment-task`.
   > Note: Within a pipeline definition, the tasks will be used like `- task: vercel-deployment-task@1`. The `@1` represents the Major version of the task that the pipeline should use. Make sure to indicate the latest major version of the task when creating your pipeline.

Explore the following pipeline guides for further set up instructions:

- [Basic Pipeline Set Up](#basic-pipeline-set-up)
- [Full Featured Pipeline Set Up](#full-featured-pipeline-set-up)

## Basic Pipeline Set Up

This short guide will demonstrate how the extension can be used to automatically deploy the `main` branch to production. Make sure the steps in [Extension Set Up](#extension-set-up) have been completed.

1. Start by creating a new pipeline file in your repo called `basic-pipeline.yml`. Either use the in-browser editor, or in your local file editor.
1. Add a `trigger:`, `pool:`, and `steps:` declarations:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     - main

   pool:
     vmImage: ubuntu-latest

   steps:
   # - task: ...
   ```

   > The `trigger:` declaration states that this pipeline should run for all commits to the `main` branch.

1. Now add the extension's task `vercel-deployment-task`:
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - task: vercel-deployment-task@1
       name: Deploy
       inputs:
         vercelProjectId: "<project-id>"
         vercelOrgId: "<org-id>"
         vercelToken: "<vercel-token>" # '$(VERCEL_TOKEN)'
         production: true
   ```
   - The `vercelToken` should reference the secret variable defined in [Extension Set Up](#extension-set-up).
1. Commit, and push the pipeline to the repository.
1. Navigate to Azure Pipelines and run the task for the first time if it doesn't run automatically.
1. Make a change to your project and commit to the `main` branch, a new deployment pipeline run should automatically kick off in Azure Pipelines, and the Vercel Project should automatically update.

## Full Featured Pipeline Set Up

This guide will demonstrate how to improve the [Basic Pipeline Set Up](#basic-pipeline-set-up) pipeline in order to deploy from `main` to production _and_ deploy from pull requests to preview.

1. Starting with the pipeline file created in [Basic Pipeline Set Up](#basic-pipeline-set-up), duplicate, rename, or open it in your editor of choice.
1. Add a variable above the `steps` block
   ```yaml
   variables:
     isMain: $[eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main')]
   ```
1. Update the `production: true` input to be `production: $(isMain)`
1. Below `inputs:`, add a `condition`:
   ```yaml
   inputs:
     # ...
   condition: or(eq(variables.isMain, true), eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest'))
   ```
1. Then add a new task step immediately after the `vercel-deployment-task` step, adding the PR commenting feature:
   ```yaml
   - task: vercel-azdo-pr-comment-task@1
     inputs:
       azureToken: $(AZURE_PAT)
       deploymentTaskMessage: $(Deploy.deploymentTaskMessage)
   ```
   - The `vercel-deployment-task` sets an output variable called `deploymentTaskMessage`. The reference `$(Deploy.deploymentTaskMessage)` comes from the `name: Deploy` on the `vercel-deployment-task` step.
1. Push these changes to the repository, and set a [Build Policy](#azure-build-policy-set-up) for the `main` branch.
1. Now create a new branch, push a commit, and open a PR against `main`. A new pipeline execution should trigger and it should create a preview deployment on Vercel as well as comment back on the PR with the preview URL.
